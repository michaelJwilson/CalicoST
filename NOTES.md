### TODO
- Include output directory in provided example data.

### Questions
- Why is it necessary to download the SNP panel and phasing panel for an example that provides the reduced matrices?
- 2 instead of 5 realizations for installation test (runtime).
- wisdom of naming random realizations calicost/clone* etc.?
- in config, phasing_panel -> phasing_panel_dir
- in config, chromosomes=[18,19].
- threads to run_calicost:  limits threading in numpy?
- wildcards: outputdir=calicost? NB prevents target rules.
