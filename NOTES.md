### Questions
- Add <REPLACE_ME> to empty values in the example config.
- Why is it necessary to download the SNP panel and phasing panel for an example that provides the reduced matrices?
- Include output directory in provided example data.
- 2 instead of 5 realizations for installation test (runtime).
- wisdom of naming random realizations calicost/clone* etc.?
- in config, region_vcf -> region_vcf_gz
- in config, phasing_panel -> phasing_panel_dir
- in config, chromosomes=[18,19].
- remove package specifications from setup.py
- threads to run_calicost:  limits threading in numpy?
- spaceranger_dir: "output_dir"
- wildcards: outputdir=calicost? NB prevents target rules.
